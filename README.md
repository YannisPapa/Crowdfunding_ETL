# Crowdfunding_ETL

This is my submission for Project 2 with Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp.

The ETL_Mini_Project_YPapadopoulos.ipynb and crowdfunding_db_schema.sql files can be found above in this repo along with a Resources folder containing .xlsx and .csv files.

There are 2 sub folders one for Resources containing some csv and excel files and one containing some files relating to the database and schema. Running ETL_Mini_Project_YPapadopoulos.ipynb will give you a notebook analyzing the data from the excel files in Resources and will create cleaned versions of the data in csv files. These csv files are then used to create a database using the crowdfunding_db_schema.sql file on pgAdmin.
